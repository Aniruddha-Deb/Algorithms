# Some general python tips:
#
# 1. Python is extremely useful when integers of arbitrary size are required:
#    eg finding the sum of digits of 2^100 or 100! or stuff like that
#
# 2. Python has built in memoization! use @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=none) 
#    for this. Note that this might exceed memory, so use a max size when 
#    possible
