# Linear congruential generator
# the simplest RNG, the state transition of a LCG is given by 
# X_n+1 = (aX_n + c) mod m
#
# choices for a, c and m:
# 1. m and c are coprime
# 2. If q is a prime number that divides m, then q divides a-1
# 3. If 4 divides m, then 4 divides a-1 
#
# some precomputed choices:
# - For m a power 2, m=2^b, and câ‰ 0, Longest possible period P=m=2^b is achieved 
#   if c is relative prime to m and a=1+4k, where k is an integer
# - For m a power 2, m=2b, and c=0, Longest possible period P=m/4=2^{b-2} is achieved
#   if the seed X0 is odd and a=3+8k or a=5+8k, for k=0,1,...
# - For m a prime and c=0, Longest possible period P=m-1 is achieved if the 
#   multiplier a has property that smallest integer k such that a*k-1 is 
#   divisible by m is k = m-1
